# Battleship Game in C++

## Overview
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Battleship game in C++. The game allows two players to place their ships on a grid and take turns to guess the location of the opponent's ships. The player who sinks all of the opponent's ships first wins the game.

## Features
- **Grid-based gameplay:** 10x10 grid for each player.
- **Ship placement:** Players can place ships of varying sizes (Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer) either horizontally or vertically.
- **Turn-based mechanics:** Players take turns to guess the location of the opponent's ships.
- **Hit and miss indicators:** Visual feedback on the grid to show hits and misses.
- **Win condition:** The game ends when one player sinks all of the opponent's ships.
